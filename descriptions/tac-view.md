# TAC View

The system equips an AV Terminal that interfaces with Targeting Pod (TGP) and turret camera feeds, essentially operating as a [ROVER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROVER) (Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver) System. This technology allows for advanced surveillance and reconnaissance, providing real-time video feeds to personnel on the ground from airborne assets.

### Enhanced Situational Awareness through AV Terminal

Users benefit from an enriched situational awareness experience with features including:

* **Player Position**: Accurately pinpoint the location of players within the environment for coordination and strategy planning.
* **Dark Mode**: An eye-friendly interface option for low light conditions, ensuring the screen is comfortable to view for extended periods.
* **Air Vehicle Connections**: Seamlessly connect to various air vehicles for data sharing.
* **Waypoints**: manage navigation waypoints for effective pathfinding and movement coordination.
* **Targeting Positions**: Designate and share targeting information from the current connected vehicle with other team members.
