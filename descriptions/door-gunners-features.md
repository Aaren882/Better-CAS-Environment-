# Door Gunners Features

The SpotLight and Laser system is an enhancement designed for door gunners in various simulated combat/Transport vehicles. It integrates with the <mark style="color:yellow;">ACE (Advanced Combat Environment)</mark> mod's self-action menu, providing an additional layer of immersion and functionality during missions.

**Key Features:**

* **SpotLight**: A powerful searchlight that can be controlled by the door gunner to illuminate targets or areas of interest during low-light or night-time operations, enhancing visibility and mission capabilities.
* **Laser Designator**: An aiming device that emits a laser beam, used by the door gunner to mark targets for precision engagement or for coordination with other units on the battlefield.

**Compatibility:**

* This system is compatible with a wide range of mod vehicles, ensuring that users can experience the enhanced functionality across different platforms without the need for individual mod adjustments.

**ACE Self-Action:**

* Integration with <mark style="color:orange;">ACE Self-Action</mark> means that door gunners can activate and control the SpotLight and Laser features directly from their in-game action menu, allowing for seamless and intuitive use during gameplay.

#### How to Use:

1. Enter the mod vehicle as a door gunner.
2. Access the ACE Self Action menu by pressing the <mark style="color:yellow;">Action</mark> key\
   (usually bound to the <mark style="color:yellow;">**LCtrl + Win**</mark> keys by default).
3. Select the SpotLight or Laser option from the menu to activate the feature.
4. Adjust and control the SpotLight or Laser as needed to support the mission objectives.
